Zang.io Test
==================================

Demo
------------
http://zangio.herokuapp.com/api/action/make-call?dialNumber={Your number}

Working flow
-------------
- zang.io initiates a call to the dial number.
- once you answer the call, it will dial to the zang.io number (which I added inside) so that you two can talk
- the bot will say something and play mp3

Features in future:
--------------
- You can interrupt live call using play-audio-in-live-call
- Also you can change your tone by specifying in inboundXML
